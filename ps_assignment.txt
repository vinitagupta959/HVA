in this video we talk about bilingualism. in old time we thing bilingual is not good for us especially children but now we know that thing or thought was wrong. bilingualism increasing our concentration, problem solving and memory. it's like gym mental gym. because when we learn new language that time we challenge our mind for this and it's very good exercise for our brain.

now widely accepted it's very benifical being bilingual. 
in one study said that binlingual peopel devlop dementia 4 and half year later  because bingual peopel chalange tharer mind and thire mind is mostly active that why. 
when we learn new lungauge as a child that time we build a new network but when we learn in later that time we modify the netwwork it's more changing and benefits also be grater but 2023 study suggest us to children 8 to 10 thry are three typ of children first monolingual, early bilingual and later bilingual. when doctors scan thire brain that time they notice early bilingual children's mind more active and and connective with network and that is not found before this study and later bilingual children face more challenge to learn new language 
recent study fond that we are emotionally connected with first language becouse we learn from family and friend and we rationally connected with second language because we learn from school office and university.
