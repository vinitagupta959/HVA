## HVA Tasks

This repository includes the tasks I’ve completed as part of the HVA learning journey. It’s a collection of small frontend projects and assignments that helped me practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You're welcome to explore the code, share feedback, or suggest improvements. It's all part of learning and growing
