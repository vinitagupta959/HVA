# Write a program that takes a number n as input and prints the first n terms of the Fibonacci Series.
# The Fibonacci Series is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
# Series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, â€¦
# Sample Input: 
# 10
# Sample Output: 
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

num=int(input())
a=0
b=1
c=0
i=0
while i<num:
    print(a,end=" ")
    c=a+b
    a=b
    b=c
    i+=1
