# You are given a string. Create a new string that contains each character of the original string only once, preserving the order of their first occurrences.
# Sample Input: 
# programming
# Sample Output: 
# progamin
# Explanation: We print a new string removing the repeating characters. R, m and g were repeating in the given string "programming" and hence were removed from the new string.
